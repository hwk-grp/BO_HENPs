# Active Learning-Driven Discovery of Sub-2 nm High-Entropy Nanocatalysts for Alkaline Water Splitting 

This repository is for sample Python codes used to optimize catalyst composition for alkaline water splitting. We executed these codes sequentially for two sequential rounds. 

Requirements
---------
scikit-learn
numpy
pandas

The 1st Round
---------

(1) HER reaction
Please excute exec_obj_HER.py


(2) OER reaction
Please excute exec_obj_OER.py

The 2nd Round 
---------
(1) HER reaction
Please excute exec_obj_HER.v2.py
